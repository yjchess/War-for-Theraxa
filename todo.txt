For next time:

Must do:
	
1. create abilities / skills for units (focus on wizard first)
2. write code for cutscenes, ensure player can't interact with board until dialogue is over
3. add background music and sound effects
4. add menu functionality within levels
5. add win screen
 
Should do:

1. create a flashing effect on a unit when they take damage
2. create an attack animation for each unit
3. Add achievements
4. create a file to store player progress


Could do:
	
1. Better movement code
	units actually move to squares
	units cannot jump over other units - must go around
2. Add transitions when changing scenes
3. attack animation plays in the middle of screen when a unit attacks another unit i.e. advance wars
