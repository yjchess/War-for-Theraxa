For next time:

Must do:
	
1. add background music and sound effects
2. add menu functionality within levels
3. finish making upgrade menu (normal upgrades cost 3 yellow + 2 blue, special upgrades cost 1 purple + 2 blue)
4. make a save system
5. improve campaign_map visuals

 
Should do:

1. create a flashing effect on a unit when they take damage
2. create an attack animation for each unit


Could do:
	
1. Better movement code
	units actually move to squares
	units cannot jump over other units - must go around
2. Add transitions when changing scenes
3. attack animation plays in the middle of screen when a unit attacks another unit i.e. advance wars
